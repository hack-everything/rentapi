The RentAPi Terms of Service (together, the "Agreement") are entered into by RentAPi and the entity or person agreeing to these terms ("Customer") and govern Customer's access to and use of the Services.

This Agreement is effective when Customer clicks to accept it (the "Effective Date"). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement.

1. Provision of the Services.

1.1 Services Use. During the Term, RentAPi will provide the Services in accordance with the Agreement, including the SLAs, and Customer may use the Services, and integrate the Services into any Customer Application that has material value independent of the Services, in accordance with the Agreement.

1.2 Admin Console. Customer will have access to the Admin Console, through which Customer may manage its use of the Services.

1.3 Accounts. Customer must have an Account to use the Services and is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its Account.  RentAPi has no obligation to provide multiple accounts to Customer.

1.4 Discontinuation of Services. RentAPi will notify a Customer at least 12 months before discontinuing any Service (or associated material functionality) unless RentAPi replaces such discontinued Service or functionality with a materially similar Service or functionality. Further, RentAPi will notify a Customer at least 12 months before significantly modifying a product or service.  Nothing in this Section 1.4 (Discontinuation of Services) limits RentAPi's ability to make changes required to comply with applicable law, address a material security risk, or avoid a substantial economic or material technical burden. This Section 1.4(Discontinuation of Services) does not apply to pre-general availability Services, offerings, or functionality.

1.5 Service Specific Terms and Data Processing and Security Terms. The Service Specific Terms and Data Processing and Security Terms are incorporated by this reference into the Agreement.

2. Payment Terms.

2.1 Online Billing. At the end of the applicable Fee Accrual Period or as otherwise stated by RentAPI in the Admin Console, RentAPi will issue an electronic bill to Customer for all charges based on Customer's use of the Services during the applicable Fee Accrual Period (including, if applicable, the relevant Fees for TSS). Customer will pay all Fees in the currency stated in the invoice. If Customer elects to pay by credit card, debit card, or other non-invoiced form of payment, RentAPi will charge (and Customer will pay) all Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period. If Customer elects to pay by invoice (and RentAPi agrees), all Fees are due as stated in the invoice. Customer's obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. RentAPi's measurement of Customer's use of the Services is final.  RentAPi has no obligation to provide multiple bills. Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by RentAPi.

2.2 Taxes.

(a) Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay  RentAPi for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If  RentAPi is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer and Customer will pay such Taxes to  RentAPi in addition to the Fees, unless Customer provides  RentAPi with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate.

(b) If required under applicable law, Customer will provide RentAPi with applicable tax identification information that RentAPi may require to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be liable to pay (or reimburse RentAPi for) any taxes, interest, penalties, or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by Customer.

2.3 Invoice Disputes & Refunds. Any invoice disputes must be submitted before the payment due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to  RentAPi, RentAPi will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If the disputed invoice has not yet been paid, RentAPi will apply the credit memo amount to the disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on that invoice. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating to Fees unless claimed within 60 days after the invoice date. Refunds (if any) are at RentAPi's discretion and will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates RentAPi to extend credit to any party.

2.4 Delinquent Payments; Suspension. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by  entAPi in collecting such delinquent amounts. If Customer is late on payment for the Services, RentAPi may Suspend the Services or terminate the Agreement for breach under Section 8.2 (Termination for Breach).

2.5 No Purchase Order Number Required. Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for RentAPi to provide a purchase order number on  RentAPi's invoice (or otherwise).

4.2 Other Suspension. Notwithstanding Section 4.1 (AUP Violations), RentAPi may immediately Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services if (a)  RentAPi believes Customer's or any Customer End User's use of the Services could adversely impact the Services, other customers' or their end users' use of the Services, or the RentAPi network or servers used to provide the Services; (b) there is suspected unauthorized third-party access to the Services; (c)  RentAPi believes it is required to Suspend immediately to comply with applicable law; or (d) Customer is in breach of Section 3.3 (Restrictions).
